# Cartoon-Random-Link-Generator
I like to watch random episodes of the simpsons while I do menial tasks (cleaning, etc). I got tired of manually navigating to the episodes, so I made this tool.

This implementation is for The Simpsons, and is currently live at http://cs.ucsb.edu/~zhelfinstein/simpsons/

There is also an implementation for Futurama at http://cs.ucsb.edu/~zhelfinstein/futurama/
